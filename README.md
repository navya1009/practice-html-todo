To-Do List Web Application
Overview
This is a simple, responsive To-Do List web application built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, jQuery, and Font Awesome. It allows users to add tasks, mark them as completed, and delete them with a clean and modern user interface.
Features

Add Tasks: Enter a task in the input field and click the "Add" button or press Enter to add it to the list.
Mark as Completed: Check the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed (strikes through the text).
Delete Tasks: Click the trash can icon to remove a task with a smooth fade-out animation.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile devices using Bootstrap's grid system.
Modern UI: Includes a gradient background, rounded corners, hover effects, and Font Awesome icons for a polished look.
Input Validation: Prevents adding empty tasks with an alert message.

Technologies Used

HTML5: Structure of the application.
CSS3: Custom styles for enhanced UI, including a gradient background and animations.
JavaScript/jQuery: Handles dynamic task management (add, delete, toggle completion).
Bootstrap 5.3.3: Provides responsive layout and pre-styled components.
Font Awesome 6.6.0: Adds icons for the "Add" button and delete functionality.
Google Fonts (Poppins): Custom typography for a modern look.

Setup Instructions

Clone or Download: Obtain the project files (e.g., index.html).
Host Locally:
Place the index.html file in a directory.
Open it in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) directly or via a local server (recommended for CDN reliability).
For a local server, you can use tools like VS Code's Live Server extension or run python -m http.server in the directory.


Ensure Internet Access: The application relies on CDNs for Bootstrap, jQuery, and Font Awesome. An active internet connection is required unless you host these libraries locally.
Open in Browser: Navigate to index.html in your browser to use the application.

File Structure

index.html: The main file containing the HTML structure, CSS styles, and JavaScript logic.

Usage

Add a Task:
Type a task in the input field.
Click the "Add" button or press Enter.
The task will appear in the list below.


Complete a Task:
Click the checkbox next to a task to mark it as completed (adds a strikethrough effect).
Uncheck to revert.


Delete a Task:
Click the trash can icon next to a task to remove it with a fade-out animation.

Troubleshooting

Layout Issues:
Confirm Bootstrap CSS and JS are loading correctly.
Test on a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
